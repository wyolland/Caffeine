# Caffeine
A fast machine learning framework.

This framework aims at people who are new to machine learning as well as experienced developers. It is supposed to be easy to use, without sacrificing performence, scalability and individuality.
Caffeine does not only provide objects for common network architectures, but can also be used to build fully customized computational graphs.
To simplify things more, Caffeine provides numeros algorithms to preprocess your data. This helps you handle huge amounts of data without spending too much valuable time.

The framework consits of three main parts.
#### Data

* This package contains plenty of methods to preprocess a dataset from a file. As an example you can run a principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the vectorspace you are operating in.
You might also be interestet in mapping a n-tuple of various datatypes to a input of a neural network, wich also can be done by this packeage.

#### Networks

* Common architectures bla

#### Nodes
