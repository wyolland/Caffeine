# Caffeine
> A fast artficial intelligence framework.

This framework is aimed at new machine learning practitioners and experienced developers alike. Caffeine is designed to be easy to use without sacrificing performance, scalability and individuality.
Caffeine supports fully customizable computational graphs and provides common network architectures and numerous data preprocessing algorithms.

These features enable the analysis of large datasets without spending too much valuable time.

### Contents
*The framework consits of three main parts: Data, AI, and Nodes.*

#### Data

Caffeine includes methods to preprocess datasets from files.
Some examples include:
*   Gaining insights into datasets by calculating a raw overview of the data. For example, the [Apriori algorithm](http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P487.PDF) has been included to provide a statistical representation of user data.
*   Running a [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data before training a model.
*   Mapping an n-tuple of varying datatypes to the expected input-type of a neural network.

#### Artificial Intelligence

This package organizes algorithms into different branches of AI as follows.
*   Machine learning
    *   Neural networks
    *   Reinforcement learning
*   Fuzzy systems
*   Genetic computation
*   Probabilistic approaches

#### Nodes

The node package allows you to build your own computational graphs. Users can take advantage of the built-in functionality for many different operations including the implementation of complex architectures. Users may define custom nodes to execute custom operations in order to achieve their network goals.
