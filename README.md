# Caffeine

A fast artficial intelligence framework.

This framework aims at people who are new to machine learning as well as experienced developers. It is supposed to be easy to use, without sacrificing performence, scalability and individuality.
Caffeine does not only provide objects for common network architectures, but can also be used to build fully customized computational graphs.
To simplify things more, Caffeine provides numeros algorithms to preprocess your data. This helps you handle huge amounts of data without spending too much valuable time.

The framework consits of three main parts.
#### Data

This package contains plenty of methods to preprocess a dataset from a file. As an example you can run a principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the vectorspace you are operating in.
You might also be interestet in mapping a n-tuple of various datatypes to a input of a neural network, wich also can be done by this packeage. To get a first raw overwiew of the data, this package contains e.g. the A Prori algorithm to calculate some basic statistical numbers.

#### Artificial Intelligence

This package is organized in the different branches of AI. On the top level, the branch of machine learning, fuzzy systems, genetic computation and probabilistic approaches cluster the many different algorithms into groups.
* Machine learning
  * Neural networks
  * Reinfocement learning
* Fuzzy systems
* Genetic computation
* Probabilistic approach

#### Nodes

The node package allows you to build your own computational graphs. You can take advantage of the build in functionality for many different operations and even coplex architectures. In addition you are able to define your own nodes with custom operations, to achive your goal.
